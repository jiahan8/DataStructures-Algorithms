data structures

list - allow duplicate obj
set - don’t allow duplicate obj, can’t have more than 1 element refer to same obj (or obj that are consider equal)
map - key-values pair

Access (get), Search(contains), Insert, Delete, Sort
linear vs non-linear

Object
- Arrays
- Collections

Arrays
- Array

List
- ArrayList - O(1), O(n), O(1), O(n), 
- LinkedList (List, Queue)
    - singly LinkedList - O(n), O(n), O(1), O(1), 
    - doubly LinkedList - O(n), O(n), O(1), O(1), 
    - circular LinkedList - 
- Vector

Vector
- Stack - first in last out - O(n), O(n), Push O(1), Pop O(1)

Queue
- Queue - first in first out - O(n), O(n), Enqueue O(1), Dequeue O(1)
- Priority Queue - 


Set
- HashSet - get O(1), contains O(1), add O(1), remove O(1), 
    - LinkedHashSet - O(1), O(1), O(1), O(1), 
SortedSet
- TreeSet - O(log n), O(log n), O(log n), O(log n), 

Map
- HashMap - get O(1), ContainsKey O(1), put O(1), remove O(1) - average lookup time is O(1), worst case look up time is O(n) if hash function is not good
    - LinkedHashMap - O(1), O(1), O(1), O(1), 
- HashTable - O(X), contains O(n), add O(n), remove O(n) - similar to HashMap, average lookup time is O(1), worst case look up time is O(n) if hash function is not good
- HashTree
SortedMap
- TreeMap - get O(log n), ContainsKey O(log n), put O(log n), remove O(log n)

Trees
Binary Trees
- Binary Search Tree - O(X), search O(n), insert O(n), delete O(n) - most of the time O(log n) for search, insert and delete
- Binary Tree - O(X), search O(n), insert O(n), delete O(n) 
Heaps
- Binary Heap - O(X), search O(n), insert O(log n), delete O(log n), peek O(1), merge O(n)
- Heap - O(X), search max/min O(1), insert O(log n), delete max/min O(log n), search then delete O(n)

Graphs -  Directed Graph, Undirected Graph, dense graph (eg. complete graph), sparse graph (few edges), breadth first search, depth first search
- AdjacencyList - check if there is edges between 2 nodes O(n), directed graph O(n^2), undirected graph O(n)
- AdjacencyMatrix - check if there is edges between 2 nodes O(1), directed graph O(n^2), undirected graph O(n^2)
- Graph
- Directed Graph
- Undirected Graph

Hashes
- HashList
- RollingHash
